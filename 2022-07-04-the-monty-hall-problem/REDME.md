# The Monty Hall Problem

Ref: [The Monty Hall Problem: A Statistical Illusion](https://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/)

Monty Hall asks you to choose one of three doors. One of the doors hides a prize
and the other two doors have no prize. You state out loud which door you pick,
but you don’t open it right away. Monty opens one of the other two doors,
and there is no prize behind it. At this moment, there are two closed doors,
one of which you picked. The prize is behind one of the closed doors, but you
don’t know which one. Monty asks you, «Do you want to switch doors?»
