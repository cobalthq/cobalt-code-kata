# FizzBuzz

Ref: [https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)

We will try a functional approach for this one, where a problem sounds like follows:

> Implement a function that takes a non-negatove number as an input and returns a string that is:
>
> * If a number is divisible by 3, return "Fizz"
> * If a number is divisible by 5, return "Buzz"
> * If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 return "FizzBuzz"
> * Otherwise return string representation of the number 1 -> "1", 2 -> "2"
