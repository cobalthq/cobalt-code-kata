# Linter Rule Using Pattern Matching

Heavily inspired by the article [ASTs in Ruby - Pattern Matching](https://dev.to/baweaver/asts-in-ruby-pattern-matching-mjd)

Implement a syntax tree checker that would suggest using [numbered parameters](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Proc.html#class-Proc-label-Numbered+parameters)
in blocks.
