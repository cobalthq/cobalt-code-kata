# Quines

A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing))).

## Proof

It can be proven that any Turing-complete language is capable of a quine. [A good article to read on the matter](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html).
