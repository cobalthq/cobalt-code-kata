# Random Number Generator

![nine](./img/nine_cat.png)

On this kata we'll attempt to implement and test a random number generator.
We'll address the following topics:

1. Is it possible to implement an RNG through TDD?
2. What can we test in an RNG?
3. What are possible RNG usages and how it defines implementation?
4. What is secure random?
