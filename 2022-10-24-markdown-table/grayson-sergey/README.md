Provider of our 17th Code Kata is [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/).
If you are not subscribed to her newsletter [rendezvous with cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)
you should definitely do so.

As our kata we will be solving an interview question from [August 21 issue](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/find-something-youre-passionate-about-and-keep/):

> Given a string that represents a markdown table, return a formatted markdown table.

```text
Input:
| Syntax | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

Output:
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```

## How to Solve

You can participate synchronously during our meetings or asynchronously.
There will be 2 meetins as usual.

### Sync

1. Join the call;
2. Find a partner or get assigned one randomly;
3. Copy a [template](../templates/) to a new folder within [this folder](.) with
   your team name;
4. Solve it using turn-based TDD:
   a. One person write a failing test;
   b. Another person makes the test pass, refactors and writes a new failing test;
   c. Back the the first person to make tests pass and repeat;
   d. The excercise ends once the time runs out or no one can write a failing test;
5. Create a PR to this repo.

### Async

1. If you find a partner, do steps 2-5 from previous section;
2. If not, be sure to submit a PR.
